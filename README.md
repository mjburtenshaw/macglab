Usage

### Commands

- [`list`](#list)

#### `list`

Prints GitLab Merge Request (MRs) authors and URLs to the terminal.

```
macglab list [OPTIONS...]
```

`list` fetches MRs meeting ALL the following criteria:
- State is open.
- Belongs to [the configured group ID](#group_id).
- Is NOT a draft.
- Meets ANY of the following criteria:
    - The author is listed in [the configured usernames](#usernames).
    - The author is listed in ANY of [the configured projects](#projects); but it only returns MRs for projects the author is listed under.
    - [You](#me) are listed as a [reviewer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/reviews/#request-a-review).

`list` then excludes MRs meeting the following criteria:
- Approved by [you](#me).
- Mergeable MRs where [you](#me) are NOT the author.

##### Options

- `-a, --approved`: Include MRs [you](#me) approved.
- `-b, --browser`: Open MRs in the browser.
- `-d, --drafts`: Include draft MRs.
- `-g, --group`: ONLY include MRs where the author is listed in the provided users (*see `-u, --users`*) or [the configured usernames](#usernames).
- `-i <string>, --group-id=<string>`: Override [the configured group ID](#group_id) with the given string.
- `-m <number>, --me <number>`: Override [the configured `me`](#me) user ID with the given number.
- `-p, --projects`: ONLY include MRs where the author is listed in ANY of [the configured projects](#projects); but it only returns MRs for projects the author is listed under.
- `-r, --ready`: Include mergeable MRs.
- `-t <string>, --access-token <string>`: Override [the configured access token](#access_token).
- `-u <string>, --users=<string>`: Override [configured usernames](#usernames) and ONLY filter on usernames you provided. Accepts a CSV of usernames.

> üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Note:** `group` and `projects` are not mutually exclusive. If neither are provided, the program will run as if both are provided.
