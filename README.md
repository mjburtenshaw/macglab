üèóÔ∏è Installation
---------------

### Requirements

1. Verify you have [installed Go](https://go.dev/doc/install): `go version`
2. Verify you have `GOPATH` in your shell environment: `echo "${GOPATH}"`
3. Verify you have added Go binaries to your `PATH`: `export PATH="${GOPATH}/bin:${PATH}"`

> üêö ***Tip:** it might be worth it to add the last command to your shell config file.*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Clone this repository, move into it, install the binary, and run [the `init` command](#init):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mjburtenshaw/macglab.git
cd macglab
go install
macglab init
```

2. Define values in the config file at `$HOME/.macglab/`. See [configuration](#configuration) for details.

3. Re-source your shell or open a new terminal to run the `macglab list` command!

### Updating

To update to the latest version, pull the latest from the repository and reinstall the binary:

```sh
git checkout main
git pull
go install
```

üíª Usage
--------

### Commands

- [`init`](#init)
- [`list`](#list)

### Flags

These flags apply to the main command, `macglab`:
- `-v, --version`: Print the version to the terminal.

These flags apply to every command:
- `-h, --help`: Print help the terminal.

#### `init`

Initializes macglab.

```shell
macglab init
```

`init` does the following:

1. Checks if there's a previous installation. Exits if so.
2. Demands a home directory for this program on your machine.
3. Adds required environment variables to your shell config file.
4. Makes a new [config](#configuration) file.

The config directory is created at `$HOME/.macglab`.

The config file is located at `$HOME/.macglab/config.yml`

We support the following shells:
- zsh.

#### `list`

Prints GitLab Merge Request (MRs) authors and URLs to the terminal.

```shell
macglab list [OPTIONS...]
```

`list` fetches MRs meeting ALL the following criteria:
- State is open.
- Belongs to [the configured group ID](#group_id).
- Is NOT a draft.
- Meets ANY of the following criteria:
    - The author is listed in [the configured usernames](#usernames).
    - The author is listed in ANY of [the configured projects](#projects); but it only returns MRs for projects the author is listed under.
    - [You](#me) are listed as a [reviewer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/reviews/#request-a-review).

`list` then excludes MRs meeting the following criteria:
- Approved by [you](#me).
- Mergeable MRs where [you](#me) are NOT the author.

##### Flags

- `-a, --approved`: Include MRs [you](#me) approved.
- `-b, --browser`: Open MRs in the browser.
- `-c, --count`: Print the result count to the terminal.
- `-d, --draft`: Include draft MRs.
- `-g, --group`: ONLY include MRs where the author is listed in the provided users (*see `-u, --users`*) or [the configured usernames](#usernames).
- `-i <string>, --group-id=<string>`: Override [the configured group ID](#group_id) with the given string.
- `-m <number>, --me <number>`: Override [the configured `me`](#me) user ID with the given number.
- `-p, --projects`: ONLY include MRs where the author is listed in ANY of [the configured projects](#projects); but it only returns MRs for projects the author is listed under.
- `-r, --ready`: Include mergeable MRs.
- `-t <string>, --access-token <string>`: Override [the configured access token](#access_token).
- `-u <string>, --users=<string>`: Override [configured usernames](#usernames) and ONLY filter on usernames you provided. Accepts a CSV of usernames.

> üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Note:** `group` and `projects` are not mutually exclusive. If neither are provided, the program will run as if both are provided.
